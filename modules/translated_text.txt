Me thirteenth It was gone. I pass lambs by village.
Or then Yes ladybug Swing, Or Yes me What It was?
Me Yes love, love became, As though in God......
Already cursed to The solder, AND I itself in weeds
I pray God... AND not I know, What Little me
The one Yes warmly prayed, What Yes fun It was.
The Lord sky, and village, Lamb, seem, Have fun!
AND sun Game, not hell! And Not long sun Game,
Not long prayed... Fierce, Red
AND paradise It was lit.. As woke up, I look:
Village It was blackened, God sky Pictce
AND that It is shabby. Look I on lambs -
Not my lambs! Turned I on House -
No in me House! Not gave me God nothing!..
AND They flooded Tears, Hard Tears!.. AND girl
At herself Road Near circle me
PLOSKIN Chosen, And and She heard, What I I cry.
Came, She greeted, Rub my Tears
AND kissed... As though sun sowed,
As though all on the world became My... Lana, groves, gardens!..
AND we, joking, They drove Strangers lambs to water.

Bride!.. AND and still, as I will remember, Then heart Crying and hurts,
Why The Lord not gave Getting up Small age in Tim Paradise.
Died would, Plowing on Niva, Nothing b on the world not He knew.
Not was would in the world fool. People and [God] not cursed!
